          <p>Growing up all computer books in school used to have one thing in common, mention of the word "super computer". The explanation of its intriguing powers and the visualisation of its sheer size always used to amaze me and as weird it may sound, it was my dream to use such a machine one day.  </p>

          <p>Early morning, waking up at 5 am in the morning, I was ready to start my journey for Tezpur. I was excited to visit my university after a long time, and as I boarded the bus for Tezpur, a strong feeling of nostalgia hit me hard. I was not alone in this adventure as my friend Rabijit was also accompanying me. Our aim for the whole expedition was to get access to the only high-performance computer of our university that was hosted by the computer science & engineering department. We were excited to visit our hostel as well, and amongst all this, before we could realise it, we were standing in the middle of Tezpur waiting for a ride to the university campus</p>

            <p>Our project was mainly based on blockchain smart contract codes and Dr Utpal Sharma was supervising us. After the first few discussions with him, we started working on the implementation of solutions for the problem we were stuck at. We had applied for the high-performance computing access but getting the mere credentials took 2 days and before we could even use the computing centre it was time for us to leave for home. Two hours before the scheduled departure of our bus to Guwahati we got our credentials. Running across the department building we grabbed the first computer we could get our hands on in the basic programming lab, entered our credentials and logged into the high-performance computing system or the infamous super computer that I have been reading about since the first standard in school. Both of us stood there filled with a sense of euphoria, like kids who got hold of the Hotwheels toys, they been hearing about in the TV commercials. Enjoying our moment with one of the finest creation of humanity, a similar question came in both of ours mind at the same moment, what to do next. See the thing is that even though super computers are highly powerful, one needs to make considerable changes in their code to make the best use of it and it was kind of impossible to make the required changes in the 15 minutes we had before we needed to run for the bus to Guwahati. We decided to keep the credentials and as every Indian engineering student loves to, we decided to procrastinate and made a plan to run the updated program when we visit the university again. So this was my first encounter with a super computer and to make this whole experience even better, while coming back to Guwahati, trying to play with the program, we realised that after making few tweaks in the code we didn't even need a damn super computer to solve the problem. As I was looking through the window, an old saying came to my mind that our computer teacher used to say in school, if as a computer student your code needs a super computer to run, maybe you are not studying well enough..</p>
