          <p>The last 6 months we have spent in a lockdown, all of us have been virtually attending our classes and to be fair it is not something we all have enjoyed. I was working on a project under the supervision of <a href= "http://www.tezu.ernet.in/dcompsc/people/staff/teaching/home_page/skd.html">Dr. Sanjib Kr. Deka</a> and most of my time during the last few months went into researching for the project only. I was working on developing a blockchain-based system to monitor vaccination records and considering the recent start of Pfizer and Moderna vaccinations, interest in the focus area of our project increased. I was in the final stage of my project and was busy preparing the papers for the proposed solution when one day I received a mail from IEEE inviting us to submit papers for <a href= "https://ieeebombay.org/ibssc2020/">IEEE Bombay Section Signature Conference</a>. At this point, I would like to again remind you of how helpful IEEE membership is for Computer Science students. At first glance, the invitation appeared to be one of the many regular conference invitations IEEE send but previously I had read a paper from 2019 edition of IBSSC and hence I remembered the name. On going through the mail what caught my eye was the fact that IBSSC 2020 had a separate track for blockchain. Conferences in Computer Science are not that rare and considering the fact that most of the research work in Computer science is published in conferences only, seeing specialized Computer Science track in an IEEE conference shouldn’t be a reason to get stupefied, but trust me it is not every day I stumble upon a conference poster which has a separate track for blockchain. The timing was great considering I was looking for conferences to submit my paper and IBSSC 2020 had a great board of researchers in the field of blockchain and decentralized systems. IBSSC seemed to be a great conference to attend and I discussed it with Professor Sanjib Kr. Deka. </p>

          <p>IBSSC was supposed to be in a virtual manner but then considering the fact that even the signature conferences of IEEE and ACM were going on online, I decided to submit my article to IBSSC 2020.
            Submitting the paper was streamline as any other conference. IBSSC was using EDAS for paper submissions and IEEE has great set rules on the template of their paper and hence formatting the paper as per the need of IBSSC was not much of hard work. After submitting the paper, it was all about the peer review process. IBSSC was using a double-blind peer-review process and thus there wasn’t much of communication with the conference chair. Initially, we were informed that papers submitted to arxiv were not allowed which was confusing as IEEE clearly mentions they support the arxiv mission and arxiv preprints are allowed in their conferences but later on conference chair mailed saying they have changed their decision (Someone must have made a really terrible mistake without consulting anyone). The organizers kept postponing the final submission date and eventually there was a delay in getting the peer reviews as well. I believe conferences should stop giving a concrete date for peer review results and just mention a rough time frame they will take to complete the review process. Eventually, we received the referee comments and after some changes, the paper was accepted for IBSSC 2020. Submission of the final paper copy was followed by copyright transfer to IEEE Xplore and submission of presentation slides for the conference. All the communications were being made through email only and a few days before the conference attendees were asked to join a WhatsApp group which I found pretty funny. The conference proceedings were supposed to be through cisco webx and this was the case for the opening ceremony and most of the technical talks but when it came to paper presentation, the organizers were facing some technical error and it ended up being organized through google meet.</p>

            <p>The paper presentations went smoothly for all the tracks and all the attendees had great discussions on various papers being presented. Technical talks during the conference were pretty good as well and speakers were welcoming of discussions. Expert talk by <a href= "https://research.curtin.edu.au/supervisor/dr-vidy-potdar/">Professor Vidy Potdar</a> of Cutin University on blockchain was an interesting one with a great discussion on his opinions of blockchain’s future. There was a great panel discussion on Impact of Industry 4.0 but considering everything was through video call the panel discussion ended being more of talks by individual panellists. Never the less, sessions were informative and organizers did a great job bringing everything together. My take on an online conference is that some way or another attendees miss the feel of a physical conference where one can meet new people and have discussions on new things. Video calls are more of one-to-many conversation with most of the people having a one-way conversation only. Even after all that IBSSC did a great job putting everything together and with their special emphasize on blockchain it was an excellent learning experience for me.</p>
