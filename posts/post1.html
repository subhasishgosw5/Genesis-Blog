          <p>During the last few months COVID19 has been the main thing being discussed. Till now we have 16,99,019 confirmed cases and the number is increasing exponentially. From n-Cov to Wuhan Virus to COVID19, the names have changed but the affects keep increasing.

            Now everyone has realized that only way out of this is by stopping it from spreading and finally fighting it. As we speak the data science and ML community worldwide is trying their best and coming up with solutions to fight this pandemic.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">AI Models as virtual doctors</h2>
          <p>With the current crisis of COVID19 tests and the lack of medical practitioners AI based models are coming up to reduce the stress on them. ML engineers are coming up with AI based chat-bots that gather data from patients with flu like symptoms and determine whether he needs immediate medical attention. These type of models are useful as they reduce the stress on medical systems by automating basic screening. These models also help in determining whether a person needs a COVID19 test or not based on several parameters.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Remote sensing of body parameters</h2>
          <p>Parameters like body temperature and pulse are important parameters and they can’t be ignored. It is becoming important to measure these parameters without putting the front line workers at risk. For this computer vision based solutions are coming up which help in determining body temperature and pulse from facial skin analysis.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Diagnosis of COVID19</h2>
          <p>People are coming up with computer vision based solutions to determine if a person has COVID19. These solutions help medical systems who are finding it difficult to cope up with ever increasing number of people. Solutions are coming up that diagnose COVID19 from chest X-Rays and CT Scans within seconds.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Predicting viral-host protein-protein interactions</h2>
          <p>The protein-protein interactions between host and virus determine the affect a pathogen will have. The virus-host interactome is the entire map of interactions between a virus’s and a host’s proteins. This interactome can be seen as a blueprint of how the virus infects our bodies and replicates in our cells. Machine learning models trained with protein data have been successfully used to predict the most likely virus-host PPIs of some earlier viruses and studies are going to do same the same for COVID19.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Predicting spread through social networks</h2>
          <p>Social networks can be used for contact tracing and thus determining the spread of the virus. Machine Learning is being used to process the large scale data and thus establish an efficient contact tracing map quickly. This is especially useful in areas with less population density where cases can be limited by isolating and testing recent contacts of a COVID19 positive case.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Drug Research</h2>
          <p>People are inside their homes, they have not lived their normal lives since months. Humanity is doing it’s best it can to stop the spread of this virus. But at the end of all these lies a hope, a hope that someday someone will come up with a vaccine or a drug for COVID19 and all these will come to an end.</p>

          <p>Professionals are giving their best day and night and AI is helping them out in this. PPIs are being predicted using ML, protein folding is being analyzed and most importantly ML is helping in analysis of already available drugs and research papers to find a find a solution fast..</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
          <p>Humanity is at a war with an invisible enemy and in this war invisible computer neural networks are turning out to be humanity’s biggest weapon.
            Above were just some examples of how AI and data science community is coming together to fight COVID19. AI and Data Science professionals are doing their best to defeat COVID19 and some day we will surely get back our normal lifestyle where someone in comfort of his home can debate on twitter how AI is harmful for humanity.</p>
