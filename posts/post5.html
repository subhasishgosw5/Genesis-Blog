         <p> Non- Linear Optics, Raman Equation and discussion on graphs that look like drawn using a ruler. Sitting in front of my laptop screen, wondering how on earth people remember such weird sensor names, I felt like a brave warrior trying to tackle all the technical jargons being thrown at me while failing miserably. This pretty much sums up my first experience at a non-computer science conference.</p>

         <p>To give better context I need to go back 8 months when I decided to accept my friend’s proposal to work on interdisciplinary research. The project idea appeared to be pretty exemplary to me. We were about to try our hands-on building a deep learning model that can beat the well-accepted mathematical equation established 40 years back. Our idea was to come up with a model that can predict glass transition temperature in polymers efficiently without the need for large industrial equipment or expensive experiments. To make it even better, we aimed to get to the levels of the foxy- flory equation so that one can have a trusted method in hand while working with new polymers. Our idea was ambitious and we felt like we were about to conquer the world of material science with the power of neural networks and when we were about to sail on our voyage, we faced our first problem, none of us knew how Glass Transition Temperatures are calculated.</p>

            <span class="caption text-muted">Conference Poster</span>
            <p>What followed were long reads through technical papers in the field of material science and long night discussions on google meet or discord. On a side note, don’t how many use discord for discussing research papers but trust me the platform suits the purpose well. After discussions and literature reviews, we were ready with a plan and started our work on implementing the planned methodology, and it was by far the best part of the whole process.</p>

              <span class="caption text-muted">Found this meme funny</span>
          <p>We were ready with our results and after tons of revisions, we were preparing the papers. We were looking for conferences and decided to attend <a href= "https://jecrcconference.in/icamcm2021/">International Conference on Advances in Materials Science, Communication and Microelectronics (ICAMCM)</a> and present our work there. Our paper was mostly in the domain of Material Science and hence we decided to attend a material science conference. The review process was streamlined and after the reviews and modifications, the paper was accepted. Like any other conference, there were like 5 different final submission dates and eventually, there was a delay in reviewer results as well.</p>

          <span class="caption text-muted">Keynote Talk by Prof. Síle Nic Chormaic</span>
          <p>On the day of the conference, it was evident from the first keynote talk only that I was not in the correct place. I am bad with electronics, so bad that I don’t even understand how optical fiber works. I was bad in the introductory signal in my second semester as well and there I was sitting trying to understand the terms. In middle, I will hear some familiar words and will try to make sense of the whole sentence and within all these, revise for the presentation. <a href="https://groups.oist.jp/light/s%C3%ADle-nic-chormaic">Prof. Síle Nic Chormaic</a> gave a great talk on optics and it was very informative at the same time easy to get with the basic knowledge I had. My friend was presenting our paper and the presentation went smooth with great discussions and suggestions from the attendees. I still feel online conferences are weird with attendees behind black windows on google meet and no expressions at all.</p>

          <span class="caption text-muted">An awkward Subhasish, a happy Bitopan, a delighted Arohan and an over excited Rajdeep is what makes our great team </span>
          <p>Overall, it was a great learning experience and I enjoyed the whole process of working on an interdisciplinary project and then attending a conference with mainly discussions on topics I am not that comfortable with. With away from university, working with limited resources what made the project a success for me was the great team.</p>
