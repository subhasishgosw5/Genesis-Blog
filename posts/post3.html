          <p>We all someday or another come up with an idea that we believe will change the world for good. But for every innovative Richard Hendricks inside you, there are thousand Jian-Yang sitting somewhere on their couch surfing internet with just one intention of plagiarizing your dream Pied Piper.</p>
          <a href="#">

          <p>Plagiarism of ideas and the struggle with getting a patent for your intellectual property is what stops majority of people going public with their idea. We all have seen those posts asking people for collaboration without mentioning the actual project idea with fear of getting rekt. What creates this fear is obvious to each one of us and some solution needs to come up to tackle all these plagiarism fiasco going around us.
            Patent laws are one of the most outdated legislations in any country and this create tons of loopholes for people to copy intellectual property and get away with it. Theft of intellectual property has been a topic of hot debate since long and many bold steps have been taken to stop it.</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/opinion/china-us-intellectual-property-trump.html">Opinion, China’s Intellectual Property Theft Must Stop</a></p>


          <p>Apart from being inefficient in stopping plagiarism, another problem with current patent mechanism is that getting a patent takes more time than probably what it will take to come up with an end to end execution for the idea. In India currently getting a patent takes 4 to 6 years which is a lot of time. Putting it into perspective Mark Zuckerberg entered Forbes world billionaire’s list in 2008, which is 4 years after founding Facebook. India is working to improve its patent grant and enforcement measures, but still a lot of work needs to be done to change the image associated with whole patent process.</p>
          <p><a href="https://qz.com/india/1331613/india-is-granting-patents-like-never-before/">India is granting patents like never before</a></p>
          
          <p>Another problem with the whole patenting process is that even though we are living in a world with global economy where Indian youth is more concerned about petrol prices in Venezuela rather than his local petrol pump, patent laws are still very localized. An innovation patented with United States Patent and Trademark Office can easily be violated in a country where patent enforcement laws are not that strict. Countries like India, Brazil, Russia and China are some of the worst performers when it comes to enforcing patents and this is alarming considering the fact that these countries in together are home to almost half of the world population.</p>
          <p><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/detection-of-covid-19-presence-from-chest-x-ray-scans-using-cnn-class-activation-maps-c1ab0d7c294b">BRICs score lowest on intellectual property protection -index</a></p>
          

          <p>There is a need for standardized solution to stop violation of intellectual property. One benefit from having a standardized platform where one can easily share their ideas is that people will open up more about their ideas and this will lead to more collaborations worldwide. Collaborations lead to innovation and innovations lead to a better community.</p>
          <a>

          </a>
          <p>

          <p>A standardized platform needs to have certain qualities like it should be immutable in nature, users should be able to prove their stake and the whole process should be automated without involvement of any middleman. Enters Blockchain with it’s properties of immutability, security etc. Ethereum Smart Contracts with its nature of automating communication with ethereum blockchain, automates the whole process as well. Storing records of intellectual property in blockchain can provide with an immutable distributed ledger of records. Intellectual property records stored on blockchain can be accessed anytime by users which makes the whole process of handling patents efficient.
            To store large files there are distributed databases like InterPlanetery File Systems which can store large files without having to pay for large ethereum gas fee. A execution of the suggested solution can be found at <a href= "https://github.com/subhasishgosw5/Meridio-Chain">https://github.com/subhasishgosw5/Meridio-Chain</a>.</p>


          <p>There is an other side of the whole debate as well where people are demanding patent rules to be dropped. People want to move towards a world of opensource but it is easier said than done. Innovation needs resources and these resources cannot be provided by an opensource approach.</p>
          
          <p>To conclude intellectual property is here to stay and only way to move forward and maintain balance between innovation and collaboration is fixing the broke patent and copyright process. In the future of Web 3 blockchain can play the role of perfect tool for streamlining patents an copyrights.</p>
